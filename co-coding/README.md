# Co-Coding Test Practice Repository

## Goals

This repository is a space for practicing coding tests together.
We collaborate with teammates to solve various problems and improve our skills through feedback.

## Participants

Sienna
Adrian
Rafi

## Collaboration Rules

- Each participant will create their own branch and code individually. Example: sienna
- Submit a PR to the main branch by **Friday** each week.
- Merging will occur every Saturday.
- We will provide feedback to each other through code reviews and issues.
- We will solve 4 problems per week. (Adjustments will be made if the difficulty increases.)
- If you encounter difficult problems, create an issue using **the question issue template** to ask questions and share solutions.
- Refer to **[the milestones](https://github.com/yourusername/yourrepo/milestones)** for the specific progress.
