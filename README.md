# Coding Test Practice Log

This repository is for recording the coding test problems solved and the learning process.

## 💻 Language

- JavaScript

## 🚀 Goals

- Improve problem-solving skills by solving various algorithmic problems.
- Regularly solve problems and document the solutions to reinforce learning through repetition.
- Record the algorithms and data structures learned with each problem.

## 📈 Learning Progress

- You can find the learning logs and list of solved problems in below repositories
  - [the co-coding README](https://github.com/sgoldenbird/co-coding/blob/main/README.md)
  - [the solveit README](https://github.com/front-studium/solveit/blob/main/README.md)
- Problems to revisit are tracked in [issues](https://github.com/sgoldenbird/coding/issues)

## 🤝 Collaboration

This repository has the co-coding repository as a submodule, where collaborative coding practice takes place.
